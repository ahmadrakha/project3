<center><h2>Social<h2></center>
<center><p>In our civilization, we have three tribes. Tribe 1 is the Water Tribe, Tribe 2 is the Earth Tribe, and Tribe 3 is the Fire Tribe. Tribe 1 is the richest and Tribe 3 is the poorest. The tribes pray to many gods, The ocean god Eau, The forest goddess Terry, and The Volcano land god Volcan.  There are many gods, but these three are specific to the social standing and the tribes of the island. All the tribes pray to their gods, but depending on the location they live in, amounts to how much more they pray to a certain god. Since the Espinosa tribe is located near a river, they pray more to the water god Eau, than they would to the forest god, or the volcano god. They do this because since they are closest, they pray more to the god nearest to them, and pray because they believe that it will be the most effective. Effective meaning they pray the water god will not flood the city, but give them enough water to drink and use to farm, so there city can prosper. The Dominique tribe would pray more to the forest god in hope that the forest would flourish with more trees, so that they would be provided with more wood and resources of that sort. The Shine tribe would pray for safety, so that volcano god Volcan does not destroy the tribe or island.<p></center>

<center><h2>Political</h2></center>
<center><p>The immigration policy, monument not only cause the protection of our civilization, brought our civilians together to celebrate our holiday, “Ahmad day” and vote for senate, for our direct democracy, in the government. We allow anyone to become a citizen if they were born on Rakhian soil, but if you are an immigrant from a foreign country then you are allowed to become a citizen if you serve in our army/military/navy. This would prove that you are loyal, why risk your life to be part of something you do not care for.<p></center>

<center><h2>Intelectual</h2></center>
<center><p>Our civilization follow the ten commandments and we use these as our law, if someone breaks the law in our civilization, you will be executed. We have a colosseum where everyone on the island can get together to celebrate or vote for our senate. We took the direct democracy from Athens because it was a system that allowed for all civilians to have a say while at the same time giving the more serious government decision to the more educated. This gives no reason for rebellion or revolution to overthrow higher power because there is not a higher power to overthrow. Once you are a citizen you are equals with every other citizen, you are granted the same rights as every other civilian and must follow the same laws.</p></center> 
<center><h2>Economical</h2></center>
<center><p>The people of our civilization farm, mine the iron, and trade the surplus of the materials to other civilization. This gives everyone a reason to work some they make enough to pay taxes, which are used for building roads and housing. They trade at the ports that allow ships from other places to come in and trade with our civilians.  The river in our civilization makes it easy to get fresh water instead of salt water to give not only use for drinking, but also used for growing crops. On Rakha island we use iron coins as currency. The farmers sell their surplus to the shopkeepers on the beach and those shopkeepers trade with other civilizations.</p></center>

<center><h2>Conclusion</h2></center>
<center><p>The Idea that we have in mind to create a prosperous civilization, is to take ideas that helped  other civilizations, and implement them into our own society, while making it realistic at the same time. We took aspects from Rome for example, which is there system of citizenship. We decided that there system was great for a society not to rebel. Not only that, but we took different approaches that we think will create a prosperous civilization, one being more power to women than men. Something else that we thought was going to help is a religious civilization, and the significance of that is the unity it brings within law and in general. We believe that all of these things combined together will create a prosperous civilization.</p></center>
