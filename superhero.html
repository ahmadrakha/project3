  <center><p><font size="5">Alex Anderson, woken by the alarming sound of the perpetual knocking of the door, gets out of bed one foot at a time forcing himself to wake up. He reluctantly makes his way to the door gradually. Alex turns the door handle ninety degrees and opens the door to find his friend John yelling at him “Hurry up, we are going to be late!” and Alex replies “For what.”. John looks at him and tells him “ We were supposed to leave half  an hour ago, everyone is waiting.” Alex remembers the hiking trip they have organized and rushes to his room in a hurry and goes through his closet to put on the first shirt and first pair of pants in his sight. He then rushes back downstairs to find his signaling him to hurry up. Alex runs out the door and slams it powerfully and makes his way to John’s 2005 Honda Civic parked right out his aunt’s house. Alex and John drive for two hours until they finally reach yosemite, where they will hike on the mist trail along their senior environmental science class. They arrive at the meeting point where they find their class upset for making them wait for half an hour. Their teacher Mr. Moore tells them “Let’s not waste anymore time.” and gets the class all together to start the hike. Alex and his class start moving and go on this fascinating trip, and in the middle of the hike, they all need to go over this steep trail one by one, and when it came to be Alex’s turn, a rock the size of his fist was thrown at his foot from somewhere hidden in the trees, causing him to take a misstep.</font></p></center>
