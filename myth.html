  <center><p><font size="5">I created my myth as a representation of the religious beliefs in my society. In my civilization there are multiple gods and that is explained in the spit page. There are the most powerful ones, and three others that are tribal gods, and look over their tribes.<font></p><center>

<center><h1>Myth Story<h1></center>
<center><p>Lifetimes of generations pass, flawless of error, and perfect for the liking of the gods. That was until one person started to question everything, and thought that there was no reason<br><br>for him to give anything, if he was not getting anything back. So, the god of volcanoes, Volcan, took it upon himself to destroy the village of the one who questioned the authority and<br><br>power of the Gods. Later on, the ocean god Eau, and Volcan decided that no one else will poison the island, and they decided to create the underworld. They decided that there<br><br>needed to be one person in each of the three tribes, who decided the fate of the dead, So they did this by appointing the wisest person of each village, and told each person that<br><br> there would be an afterlife, and that the good people of the island will be rewarded if they have done their part, and those that<br><br>have not will be punished. They have also told them that the people that have done good will be given to the ocean god Eau and the people who sinned will be given to Volcan all after death, and they will serve as a gateway to the afterlife.<p></center>
